// Project: Connection of distance fallen and gravitation. 
// Purpose: Determine how much an object would fall under the force of gravity for every second till 20 seconds and then find out time it takes for an object to fall to the 
// ground from a particular distance, in this case 15000 m. 
// Due date: 3rd October, 2018, Wednesday.
